"We also present a simulator whose ultimate goal is to encapsulate the expected dynamics of the Web of Things for the future development of information retrieval (IR) systems. The simulator generates a real-time collection of XML documents containing spatio-temporal contexts and textual and sensed information of highly dynamic dimensions. The simulator is characterized by its flexibility and versatility for representing real-world scenarios and offers a unique perspective for information retrieval. In this article, we evaluate and test the simulator in terms of its performance variables for computing resource consumption and present our experimentation with the simulator on three real scenarios by considering the generation variables for the IR document collection."
